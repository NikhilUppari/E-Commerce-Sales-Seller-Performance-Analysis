Description:
This project focuses on analyzing an e-commerce dataset using Google BigQuery and Power BI. The dataset contains various tables, including customer details, geolocation data, order transactions, payments, products, and seller information. The objective is to clean, transform, and join these tables to gain insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and regional trends.

SQL Data Manipulation:  
The data_manipulation.sql file contains SQL queries designed for data exploration, cleaning, and transformation in Google BigQuery. Key steps include:  
- Retrieving sample records from each table.  
- Counting the total number of records in each dataset.  
- Cleaning missing values and standardizing data formats.  
- Creating calculated fields such as total order cost.  
- Merging tables to form a comprehensive dataset for further analysis.  

Power BI Dashboard:  
The Power BI dashboard visualizes key insights derived from the cleaned and processed dataset. It includes:  
- Sales Performance Analysis: Total revenue, order volume, and payment trends over time.  
- Customer Insights: Customer distribution by location, spending patterns, and order frequency.  
- Product Analysis: Best-selling products, average price trends, and product category performance.  
- Seller Performance: Sales distribution by sellers, revenue contribution, and regional market trends.  
- Geographical Trends: Mapping customer and seller locations to analyze regional variations in sales.  

This dashboard helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions by providing an interactive and visual representation of business performance.
